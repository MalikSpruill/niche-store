  ## Installation 
  Follow these instructions to install the necessary dependences:
  dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize were used as dependencies for the application.

  
  ## Usage 
  Follow these instructions to use the application properly:
  Once the repository is cloned or forked, from the command line, type `npm install`.  This should install the necessary packages for the application.  You would want to also create a .env file with the name of your database, your username, and your user password.  After that, type `mysql -u root -p` from the command line, and then enter your password if you have one.  Next, type `source db/schema.sql` to create the database and have it show as a selection in your mysql databases.  Finally, in another cli instance, type `npm run seed` to seed the tables, and then you'll be able to use an api platform like `Insomnia` to test the routes.
